Those who prefer the religious who live in communities
in cities before the anchorites, say that they have more worth because
they meet with more opposition; whereas those who live in solitude being
quiet and not subject to temptations, have not so much virtue; to which
Nilus replies that there are as many temptations in solitude as in
cities, and that the reason why some persons argue so is because they
regard outward sins only, not considering that there are infinite
temptations and spiritual sins which encounter us as well in privacy as
in cities; and he therefore supports the opinion that the solitary life
is the higher form of the religious life.[440] Isidore of Seville, too,
in the seventh century, distinguishes between the different kinds of
monks, and says that the Cœnobites are they that live in common, like
those in the days of the apostles, who sold their goods and had all
things in common; the Hermits, they that withdraw into desert places and
vast solitudes in imitation of Elias and John the Baptist, delighting,
with a wonderful contempt of the world, in total solitude; and the
Anchorites, they who, having perfected themselves in cœnobitical life,
shut themselves up in cells apart from the aspect of men, inaccessible
to all, and living in the sole contemplation of God.[441] But Bede, who
was a Benedictine monk, seems also to regard the life of an anchorite as
a higher form of religious life, when in his History he says of Cudberct
on his retiring to the island of Farne, that, advancing in the merits
of his devout intention, he proceeded even to the adoption of a hermit
life of solitary contemplation and secret silence; and, in his Life,
that he was now permitted to ascend to the leisure of divine
speculation, and rejoiced that he had now reached the lot of those of
whom we sing in the Psalm, The saints shall go from virtue to virtue;
the God of Gods shall be seen in Sion.[442]

The preference for this mode of life, as the highest form of a religious
life that could be attained, seems to have arisen from an overstrained
interpretation of some passages of Scripture. - number of characters: 2144

It bears the title _Columcille fecit_, and
has been thus translated:—

          Delightful would it be to me to be in _Uchd Ailiun_
            On the pinnacle of a rock,
          That I might often see
            The face of the ocean;
          That I might see its heaving waves
            Over the wide ocean,
          When they chant music to their Father
            Upon the worlds course;
          That I might see its level sparkling strand,
            It would be no cause of sorrow;
          That I might hear the song of the wonderful birds,
            Source of happiness;
          That I might hear the thunder of the crowding waves
            Upon the rocks;
          That I might hear the roar by the side of the church
            Of the surrounding sea;
          That I might see its noble flocks
            Over the watery ocean;
          That I might see the sea monsters,
            The greatest of all wonders;
          That I might see its ebb and flood
            In their career;
          That my mystical name might be, I say,
             _Cul ri Erin_ (Back turned to Ireland);
          That contrition might come upon my heart
            Upon looking at her;
          That I might bewail my evils all,
            Though it were difficult to compute them;
          That I might bless the Lord
            Who conserves all,
          Heaven with its countless bright orders,
            Land, strand, and flood;
          That I might search the books all,
            That would be good for any soul;
          At times kneeling to beloved heaven;
            At times at psalm-singing;
          At times contemplating the King of Heaven,
            Holy the chief;
          At times at work without compulsion;
            This would be delightful. - number of characters: 1847

Schism still exists in Iona.]

It appears to have been a wonderful dispensation of the Divine
goodness, that the same nation which had wittingly and without envy
communicated to the people of the Angles the knowledge of the true
Deity, should afterwards, by means of the nation of the Angles, be
brought, in those points on which they were defective, to the rule of
life; such is the reflection of the Venerable Bede when contemplating
the change which had taken place in the Columban Church in the beginning
of the eighth century, which he thus expresses: The monks of _Hii_, or
Iona, by the instruction of Ecgberct, adopted the Catholic rites under
Abbot Dunchad, about eighty years after they had sent Bishop Aidan to
preach to the nation of the Angles.[505] He had previously stated that,
not long after the year 710, those monks also of the Scottish nation
who lived in the island of Hii, with the other monasteries that were
subject to them, were, by the procurement of our Lord, brought to the
canonical observance of Easter and the right mode of tonsure;[506] and
this had been effected by the most reverend and holy father and priest
Ecgberct, of the nation of the Angles, who had long lived in banishment
in Ireland for the sake of Christ, and was most learned in the
Scriptures and distinguished for the perfection of a long life, and who
came among them, corrected their error, and changed them to the true and
canonical day of Easter.[507] Bede implies that this took place in the
year 716; but the change was not so general or so instantaneous as might
be inferred from this statement. - number of characters: 1623

Fillan, the ecclesiastic
jurisdiction, with the custody of his pastoral staff, called the
Coygerach, seems to have fallen, as we find from an inquest held at
Kandrochid, or Killin, on the 22d April 1428, that the office of
bearing the said relique belonged hereditarily to the progenitor of
Finlay Jore, who appeared before the jury as the successor of Saint
Felan with that office, and that these privileges had been preserved in
the time of King Robert Bruce, and in the time of the subsequent kings
to the present day, in virtue of which the family possessed a certain
jurisdiction which bears an obvious relation to that possessed in the
reign of King William by the abbot of Glendochart; and in the year 1487
there is a letter by King James, in which the king states that his
servitour Malice Doïre and his forebearis has had ane relik of Sanct
Fulane, called the quegrith, in keping of us and of our progenitors
since the time of King Robert the Bruys and of before, and made nane
obedience nor answer to na persone spirituale nor temporale in ony thing
concerning the said haly relik, and charging all and sundry to mak him
nane impediment, letting, or distroublance in the passing with the said
relik throch the contre as he and his forebearis wes wount to do.[767]

[Sidenote: Formation of the diocese of Argyll or Lismore.]

The districts, belonging to the bishopric of Dunkeld, which lay to the
west of the great range of Drumalban were, about the year 1200,
separated from it and formed into a new bishopric termed first that of
Argyll and afterwards that of Lismore. - number of characters: 1604

In a document containing the judgment of the
popes delegates in a question between the bishop of Dunblane and the
earl of Menteith, in the year 1238, we read that the bishop had gone in
person to Rome and represented to the pope that the church of Dunblane
had formerly been vacant for a hundred years and more, and almost all
its possessions had been seized by secular persons; and, although in
process of time several bishops had been appointed to her, yet by their
weakness and indifference the possessions thus appropriated had not only
not been recovered, but even what remained to them had been almost
entirely alienated; in consequence of which no one could be induced to
take upon himself the burden of the episcopate, and the church had thus
remained without a chief pastor for nearly ten years; that the present
bishop, when appointed, had found the church so desolate that he had not
a cathedral church wherein to place his head; that there was no
collegiate establishment; and that in this unroofed church the divine
offices were celebrated by a certain rural chaplain, while the bishops
revenues were so slender that they scarce afforded fitting maintenance
for half the year.[760] This picture of clerical desolation does not
differ from what we have found in other churches the possessions of
which had fallen into the hands of lay families, and it is quite
inconsistent with the statement that there was a body of _Keledei_ in
the church of Dunblane. - number of characters: 1487

Anthony, called him a _Deicola_, and, indulging in
the expression of natural affection, they loved him, some as a son,
others as a brother.[446] Again, Martinus, a bishop, who terms himself
Scotus, or a native of Ireland, writing to Miro, king of Gallicia, in
the sixth century, probably about the year 560, regarding the rules of
an honest life, says that he will not urge him to follow those more
arduous and perfect rules which are practised by a few very excellent
_Deicolæ_.[447] Columbanus, too, in his second instruction or sermon to
his monks, says, Whosoever, therefore, willeth to be made a habitation
for God, let him strive to become lowly and quiet, that not by glibness
of words, nor by suppleness of body, but by the reality of his humility
he may be recognised as a _Deicola_; for goodness of heart requireth not
the feigned religion of words;[448] and a disciple of Columbanus, who
followed out this life after his master had been driven out of Luxeuil
with his monks, retired to a solitary spot called Luthra in the midst of
a forest, now Lure in the district of Besançon, But his virtues having
attracted religious men to him from all quarters, he formed a community
of monks and erected two oratories; and, after governing his monastery
for several years, he appointed one of his disciples abbot in his stead,
and again withdrew to a solitary cell, where he devoted himself to
divine contemplation till his death about 625. - number of characters: 1463

For the divine goodness so ordained it that, as he was
a great lover of peace and unity, he should be taken away to everlasting
life before he would be obliged, on the return of the time of Easter, to
have still more serious discord with those that would not follow him in
the truth.[346] It would therefore appear that Adamnan did not return
to Iona till the year of his death, which took place on the 23d of
September in the year 704, and in the seventy-seventh year of his
age.[347]

At what period of Adamnans abbacy he wrote his life of the patron saint
and founder of the monastery cannot be fixed with any accuracy, but it
was after his visit to Aldfrid in 688; and, as he states that he did so
at the urgent request of his brethren, and alludes incidentally to the
discord which arose among the churches of Ireland on account of the
difference with regard to the Easter feast, it was probably compiled
before the same discord had arisen between the brethren of Iona and
himself as their abbot.[348] Neither can the precise period be fixed
when he founded those churches in the eastern districts which are
dedicated to him; but no doubt, after the termination of the Anglic rule
over the southern Picts and Scots of Dalriada, he would be desirous to
strengthen the Columban Church; and his relations with the kings of the
Picts who reigned after the overthrow of the Angles were, as we have
seen, cordial and friendly. - number of characters: 1447

In it he refers to the cycle introduced into use by our
pope, Saint Patricius;[29] and Adamnan, writing in the end of the
seventh century, in the second preface to his Life of Columba mentions
Maucta, a pilgrim from Britain, a holy man, a disciple of Saint
Patricius the bishop.[30] These early notices, though few in number,
seem sufficient to prove his existence; but if we are to receive as
genuine documents his Confession and the Epistle to Coroticus, as
undoubtedly we ought, they not only afford conclusive evidence of his
own existence and the reality of his mission, but give us his own
account of the leading particulars of his life.[31] The information he
gives us may be shortly stated thus:—Patricius was born of Christian
parents and belonged to a Christian people; for he was the son of
Calpornius a deacon, son of the late Potitus a presbyter, who lived in
the village of Bannavem of Tabernia, where he had a small farm.[32] He
was of gentle birth, his father being also a decurio, that is, one of
the council or magistracy of a Roman provincial town.[33] He lived at
this little farm when, in his sixteenth year, he was taken captive and
brought to Hibernia or Ireland with many thousands; and he adds, as we
deserved, for we had forsaken God, and had not kept his commandments,
and were disobedient to our priests, who admonished us for our
salvation. - number of characters: 1389

The Scots most
willingly received them all, and took care to supply them gratuitously
with daily food, as also to furnish them with books to read and their
teaching, without making any charge;[789] and of Aldfrid, son of King
Osuiu, who succeeded his brother Ecgfrid, when he was slain by the Picts
in 685, as king of Northumbria, Bede says that he was a man most
learned in Scripture, that he at that time lived in exile in the
islands of the Scots for the sake of studying letters, and that,
previous to his accession to the throne, he had for a considerable time
gone into voluntary exile in the regions of the Scots, for the sake of
acquiring learning, through the love of wisdom.[790] We hear, too, in
the Life of Senan, of fifty Roman monks who came to Ireland for the
purpose of leading a life of stricter discipline, or improving
themselves in the study of the Scriptures then much cultivated in
Ireland, and became pupils of those holy fathers who were most
distinguished for sanctity of life and the perfection of monastic
discipline.[791]

[Sidenote: Iona as a school of learning.]

The Monastic Church, founded by Columba in Iona, was not behind its
mother church of Ireland in this respect; and we are told by his
biographer, Adamnan, that Columba never could spend even one hour
without study, or prayer, or writing, or some other holy occupation. - number of characters: 1384

Thus, in an old poem attributed to Cuimin of
Coindeire, he says of Enda, who founded the monastery on the principal
of the Arann Isles:—

                   Enda of the high piety loved
                   In Ara, victory with sweetness,
                   A _carcair_ of hard narrow stone,
                   To bring all unto heaven.[462]

Of Ultan of Arbreccan he says—

                    Ultan loves his children;
                    A _carcair_ for his lean side,
                    And a bath in cold water
                    In the sharp wind he loved.[463]

Of Molaissi of Devenish he says—

                Molaissi of the lake loves
                To be in a _carcair_ of hard stone.[464]

Adamnan, too, tells us of _Feargna_, or Virgnous, who, after having
lived for many years without reproach in obedience among the brethren,
led an anchoretic life for other twelve years, as a victorious soldier
of Christ, in the abode of the anchorites in Muirbulcmar.[465] This
was, he also tells us, in the island of Hinba, which can be identified
with _Eilean na Naomh_, one of the Garveloch isles, and here, in this
solitary isle where there is little to disturb them, we find the remains
of this abode of the anchorites in connection with other remains which
are evidently the foundations of an early monastic establishment. - number of characters: 1361
