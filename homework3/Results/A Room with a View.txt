she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so
dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account,
and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths
that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry

old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was
not her companion to Greece. - number of characters: 476

Under the chaplains guidance
they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little
picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little
frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out
of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap
mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from
real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and
Psyche in alabaster; St. - number of characters: 473

She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed,
for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented
to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in

used them most. - number of characters: 416

If you will not think me
rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed

or through and go on somewhere else. - number of characters: 347

She looked at
the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the
row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between
the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late
Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at
the notice of the English church (Rev. - number of characters: 335

Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I
hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with

Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and
I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them. - number of characters: 334

Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in

whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened
till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something
quite different, whose existence she had not realized before. - number of characters: 332

You despise my mother—I know you do—because shes
conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!—she rose to
her feet—conventional, Cecil, youre that, for you may understand

Chapter II
In Santa Croce with No Baedeker
