HUMBLY SHEWETH,

     That your Lordships memorialist was, by the Honourable the
     Commissioners of his Majestys Navy, on the 4th of December
     last, appointed to the above employment by warrant from that
     board;

     That he accordingly proceeded to the execution of his duty
     on board of the Vernon, being one of the ships appointed to
     proceed to Africa with the above poor;

     That your memorialist, to his great grief and astonishment,
     received a letter of dismission from the Honourable
     Commissioners of the Navy, by your Lordships orders;

     That, conscious of having acted with the most perfect
     fidelity and the greatest assiduity in discharging the trust
     reposed in him, he is altogether at a loss to conceive the
     reasons of your Lordships having altered the favourable
     opinion you were pleased to conceive of him, sensible that
     your Lordships would not proceed to so severe a measure
     without some apparent good cause; he therefore has every
     reason to believe that his conduct has been grossly
     misrepresented to your Lordships; and he is the more
     confirmed in his opinion, because, by opposing measures of
     others concerned in the same expedition, which tended to
     defeat your Lordships humane intentions, and to put the
     government to a very considerable additional expense, he
     created a number of enemies, whose misrepresentations, he
     has too much reason to believe, laid the foundation of his
     dismission. - number of characters: 1553

It was now between two and three years since I first came to England,
a great part of which I had spent at sea; so that I became inured to
that service, and began to consider myself as happily situated; for my
master treated me always extremely well; and my attachment and
gratitude to him were very great. - number of characters: 1210

In the evening of the same day, as I was reading and meditating on the
fourth chapter of the Acts, twelfth verse, under the solemn
apprehensions of eternity, and reflecting on my past actions, I began
to think I had lived a moral life, and that I had a proper ground to
believe I had an interest in the divine favour; but still meditating
on the subject, not knowing whether salvation was to be had partly for
our own good deeds, or solely as the sovereign gift of God; in this
deep consternation the Lord was pleased to break in upon my soul with
his bright beams of heavenly light; and in an instant as it were,
removing the veil, and letting light into a dark place, I saw clearly
with the eye of faith the crucified Saviour bleeding on the cross on
mount Calvary: the scriptures became an unsealed book, I saw myself a
condemned criminal under the law, which came with its full force to my
conscience, and when the commandment came sin revived, and I died, I
saw the Lord Jesus Christ in his humiliation, loaded and bearing my
reproach, sin, and shame. - number of characters: 1071

I believe it is difficult for those who publish their own memoirs to
escape the imputation of vanity; nor is this the only disadvantage
under which they labour: it is also their misfortune, that what is
uncommon is rarely, if ever, believed, and what is obvious we are apt
to turn from with disgust, and to charge the writer with impertinence. - number of characters: 876

In October 1785 I was accompanied by some of the Africans, and
presented this address of thanks to the gentlemen called Friends or
Quakers, in Gracechurch-Court Lombard-Street:

     Gentlemen,

     By reading your book, entitled a Caution to Great Britain
     and her Colonies, concerning the Calamitous State of the
     enslaved Negroes: We the poor, oppressed, needy, and
     much-degraded negroes, desire to approach you with this
     address of thanks, with our inmost love and warmest
     acknowledgment; and with the deepest sense of your
     benevolence, unwearied labour, and kind interposition,
     towards breaking the yoke of slavery, and to administer a
     little comfort and ease to thousands and tens of thousands
     of very grievously afflicted, and too heavy burthened
     negroes. - number of characters: 827

I expected therefore every minute to be my last; especially
when I saw our men fall so thick about me; but, wishing to guard as
much against the dangers as possible, at first I thought it would be
safest not to go for the powder till the Frenchmen had fired their
broadside; and then, while they were charging, I could go and come
with my powder: but immediately afterwards I thought this caution was
fruitless; and, cheering myself with the reflection that there was a
time allotted for me to die as well as to be born, I instantly cast
off all fear or thought whatever of death, and went through the whole
of my duty with alacrity; pleasing myself with the hope, if I survived
the battle, of relating it and the dangers I had escaped to the dear
Miss Guerin, and others, when I should return to London. - number of characters: 815

     Turkey ship--Account of a black mans being kidnapped on
     board and sent to the West Indies, and the authors
     fruitless endeavours to procure his freedom--Some account of
     the manner of the authors conversion to the faith of Jesus

Our voyage to the North Pole being ended, I returned to London with
Doctor Irving, with whom I continued for some time, during which I
began seriously to reflect on the dangers I had escaped, particularly
those of my last voyage, which made a lasting impression on my mind,
and, by the grace of God, proved afterwards a mercy to me; it caused
me to reflect deeply on my eternal state, and to seek the Lord with
full purpose of heart ere it was too late. - number of characters: 786
