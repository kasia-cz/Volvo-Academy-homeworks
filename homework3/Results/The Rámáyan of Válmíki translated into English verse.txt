with water, covered with _Udumbara_ branches and various lotus flowers,
besides a white jewelled _chourie_, a white splendid parasol, a white
bull, a white horse, all manner of musical instruments and bards.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} In the
preceding chapter {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} there are mentioned _two_ white _chouries_ instead of
one, and all kinds of seeds, perfumes and jewels, a scimitar, a bow, a
litter, a golden vase, and a blazing fire, and amongst the living

Neither ceremony is described in these poems with the full detail which is
given of the vaidik rite in the _Aitareya-Bráhmanam_; but the allusion
that Ráma was inaugurated by _Vasishtha_ and the other Bráhmanas in the
same manner as Indra by the Vasus {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} and the observation which is made in
some passages that a certain rite of the inauguration was performed
according to the sacred rule {~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} admit of the conclusion that the ceremony
was supposed to have taken place in conformity with the vaidik
injunction.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} As the inauguration of _Ráma_ was intended and the necessary
preparations for it were made when his father Dasaratha was still alive,
but as the ceremony itself, through the intrigues of his step-mother
_Kaikeyí_, did not take place then, but fourteen years later, after the
death of _Dasaratha_, an account of the preparatory ceremonies is given in
the _Ayodhyákánda_ (Book II) as well as in the _Yuddha-Kánda_ (Book VI.)
of the Rámáyana, but an account of the complete ceremony in the latter
book alone. - number of characters: 1093

There dark and drear was every home
Where cats and owls had space to roam,
As when the shades of midnight fall
With blackest gloom, and cover all:
As Rohiní, dear spouse of him
Whom Ráhu hates,(396) grows faint and dim,
When, as she shines on high alone
The demons shade is oer her thrown:
As burnt by summers heat a rill
Scarce trickling from her parent hill,
With dying fish in pools half dried,
And fainting birds upon her side:
As sacrificial flames arise
When holy oil their food supplies,
But when no more the fire is fed
Sink lustreless and cold and dead:
Like some brave host that filled the plain,
With harness rent and captains slain,
When warrior, elephant, and steed
Mingled in wild confusion bleed:
As when, all spent her store of worth,
Rocks from her base the loosened earth:
Like a sad fallen star no more
Wearing the lovely light it wore:
So mournful in her lost estate
Was that sad town disconsolate. - number of characters: 943

When he his heavenly home had found,
The holy men who dwelt around
To Ráma flocked, whose martial fame
Shone glorious as the kindled flame:
Vaikhánasas(415) who love the wild,
Pure hermits Bálakhilyas(416) styled,
Good Samprakshálas,(417) saints who live
On rays which moon and daystar give:
Those who with leaves their lives sustain
And those who pound with stones their grain:
And they who lie in pools, and those
Whose corn, save teeth, no winnow knows:
Those who for beds the cold earth use,
And those who every couch refuse:
And those condemned to ceaseless pains,
Whose single foot their weight sustains:
And those who sleep neath open skies,
Whose food the wave or air supplies,
And hermits pure who spend their nights
On ground prepared for sacred rites;
Those who on hills their vigil hold,
Or dripping clothes around them fold:
The devotees who live for prayer,
Or the five fires(418) unflinching bear. - number of characters: 935

And those who worked the potters wheel,
And artists skilled in gems to deal;
And masters of the weavers art,
And those who shaped the sword and dart;
And they who golden trinkets made,
And those who plied the fullers trade;
And servants trained the bath to heat,
And they who dealt in incense sweet;
Physicians in their business skilled,
And those who wine and mead distilled;
And workmen deft in glass who wrought,
And those whose snares the peacock caught;
With them who bored the ear for rings,
Or sawed, or fashioned ivory things;
And those who knew to mix cement,
Or lived by sale of precious scent;
And men who washed, and men who sewed,
And thralls who mid the herds abode;
And fishers of the flood, and they
Who played and sang, and women gay;
And virtuous Bráhmans, Scripture-wise,
Of life approved in all mens eyes;
These swelled the princes lengthened train,
Borne each in car or bullock wain. - number of characters: 927

On one side is the bright god of the heaven, as beneficent
as he is irresistible: on the other the demon of night and of darkness, as
false and treachorous as he is malignant.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} The latter (as his name Vritra,
from var, to veil, indicates) is pre-eminently the thief who hides away
the rain-clouds.{~HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS~} But the myth is yet in too early a state to allow of the
definite designations which are brought before us in the conflicts of Zeus
with Typhôn and his monstrous progeny, of Apollôn with the Pythôn, of
Bellerophôn with Chimaira of Oidipous with the Sphinx, of Hercules with
Cacus, of Sigurd with the dragon Fafnir; and thus not only is Vritra known
by many names, but he is opposed sometimes by Indra, sometimes by Agni the
fire-god, sometimes by Trita, Brihaspati, or other deities; or rather
these are all names of one and the same god. - number of characters: 892
