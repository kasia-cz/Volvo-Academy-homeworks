_O Jean, in whom my spirit sees,
    Clearer than through whisky or disease,
    Its dernin nature, wad the searchin licht
    Oor union raises poord owre me the nicht._

    _Im faced wi aspects o mysel
    At last whas portent nocht can tell,
    Save that sheer licht o life that when were joint
    Loups through me like a fire a else t aroint._

    _Clear my lourd flesh, and let me move
    In the peculiar licht o love,
    As aiblins in Eternity men may
    When their swack souls nae mair are clogged wi clay._

    _Be thou the licht in which I stand
    Entire, in thistle-shape, as planned,
    And no hauf-hidden and hauf-seen as here
    In munelicht, whisky, and in fleshly fear,_

    _In fear to look owre closely at
    The grisly form in which Im caught,
    In sic a reelin and imperfect licht
    Sprung frae incongruous elements the nicht!_

    _But wert by thou they were shone on,
    Then wad I hae nae dreid to con
    The ugsome problems shapin in my soul,
    Or gin I hed—certes, nae fear youd thole!_

    _Be in this fibre like an eye,
    And ilka turn and twist descry,
    Hoo here a leaf, a spine, a rose—or as
    The purpose o the pooer that brings t to pass._

    _Syne liberate me frae this tree,
    As wha had there imprisoned me,
    The end achieved—or show me at the least
    Mair meanin int, and hope o bein released._

    I tae hae heard Eternity drip water
    (Aye water, water!), drap by drap
    On the ae nerve, like lichtnin, Ive become,
    And heard God passin wi a bobbys feet
    Ootby in the lang coffin o the street
    —Seen stang by chitterin knottit stang loup oot
    Uncrushed by th echoes o the thunderin boot,
    Till a the dizzy lint-white lines o torture made
    A monstrous thistle in the space aboot me,
    A symbol o the puzzle o mans soul
    —And in my agony been pridefu I could still
    Tine nae least quiver or twist, watch ilka point
    Like a white-het bodkin ripe my inmaist hert,
    And aye wi clearer pain that brocht nae anodyne,
    But rose for ever to a fer crescendo
    Like eagles that ootsoar wi skinklan wings
    The thieveless sun they blin
              —And pridefu still
    That yont the sherp wings o the eagles fleein
    Aboot the dowless pole o Space,
    Like leafs aboot a thistle-shank, my bluid
    Could still thraw roses up
              —And up! - number of characters: 2424

Springs spirit wi its waesome sough
      Rules owre the drucken stramash there._

      _And heich abune the vennels pokiness,
      Whaur a the white-weshed cottons lie;
      The Inns sign blinters in the mochiness,
      And lood and shrill the bairnies cry._

      _The hauflins yont the burgh boonds
      Gang ilka nicht, and a the same,
      Their bonnets cocked; their bluid that stounds
      Is playin at a fine auld game._

      _And on the lochan there, hauf-herted
      Wee screams and creakin oar-locks soon,
      And in the lift, heich, hauf-averted,
      The mune looks owre the yirdly roon._

      _And ilka evenin, derf and serious
      (Jean ettles nocht o this, puir lass),
      In liquor, raw yet still mysterious,
      Ae freends aye mirrored in my glass._

      _Ahint the sheenin coonter gruff
      Thrang barmen ding the tumblers doun
      In vino veritas cry rough
      And reid-eend fules that in it droon._

      _But ilka evenin fey and fremt
      (Is it a dream nae wauknin proves?)
      As to a trystin-place undreamt,
      A silken leddy darkly moves._

      _Slow gangs she by the drunken anes,
      And lanely by the winnock sits;
      Fraer robes, atour the sunken anes,
      A rooky dwamin perfume flits._

      _Her gleamin silks, the taperin
      O her ringed fingers, and her feathers
      Move dimly like a dream wiin,
      While endless faith aboot them gethers._

      _I seek, in this captivity,
      To pierce the veils that darklin fa
      —See white clints slidin to the sea,
      And hear the horns o Elfland blaw._

      _I hae dark secrets turns and twists,
      A sun is gien to me to haud,
      The whisky in my bluid insists,
      And spiers my benmaist history, lad._

      _And owre my brain the flitterin
      O the dim feathers gangs aince mair,
      And, faddomless, the dark blue glitterin
      O twa een in the ocean there._

      _My soul stores up this wealth unspent,
      The key is safe and nanes but mine. - number of characters: 2070

_Melville, sea-compelling man,
    Before whose wand Leviathan
    Rose hoary-white upon the Deep,[14]
    What thou hast sown I fain ud reap
    O knowledge yont the human mind
    In keepin wi oor Scottish kind,
    And, thanks to thee, may aiblins reach
    To what this Russian has to teach,
    Closer than ony ither Scot,
    Closer to me than my ain thocht,
    Closer than my ain braith to me,
    As close as to the Deity
    Approachable in whom appears
    This Christ o the neist thoosand years._

    As frae your baggit wife
    You turned whenever able,
    And often when you werena,
    Unto the gamin table,
    And opened wide to ruin
    Your benmaist hert, aye brewin
    A horror o whatever
    Seemed likely to deliver
    You frae the senseless strife
    In which alane is life,
    —As Burns in Edinburgh
    Breenged arse-owre-heid thoro
    A _it_ could be the spur o
    To pleuch his sauted furrow,
    And turned frae a men honour
    To what could only scunner
    Wha thinks that common-sense
    Can eer be but a fence
    To keep a soul worth haen
    Frae what it sud be daein
    —Sae I in turn maun gie
    My soul to misery,
    Daidle disease
    Upon my knees,
    And welcome madness
    Wi exceedin gladness
    —Aye, open wide my hert
    To a the thistles smert. - number of characters: 1349

Impersonality sall blaw
    Through me as twere a bluffert o snaw
    To scour me o my sense o awe,

    A bluffert o snaw, the licht that flees
    Within the Wheel, and Freedom gies
    Frae Dust and Daith and a Disease,

    —The drumlie doom that only weighs
    On them wha haena seen their place
    Yet in creations lichtnin race,

    In the movement that includes
    As a tides resistless floods
    A their movements and their moods,—

    Until disinterested we,
    O a oor auld delusions free,
    Lowe in the wheels serenity

    As conscious items in the licht,
    And keen to keep it clear and bricht
    In which the haill machine is dight,

    The licht nae man has ever seen
    Till he has felt that hes been gien
    The stars themsels insteed o een,

    And often wi the sun has glowered
    At the white mune until it cowered,
    As when by new thocht aulds oerpowered. - number of characters: 927

What earthquake chitters oot
    In the Thistles oorie shape,
    What gleids o central fire
    In its reid heids escape,
    And whatna coonter forces
    In growth and ingrowth graip
    In an eternal clinch
    In this ootcuissen form
    That winna be outcast,
    But triumphs at the last
    (Owre a abies itsel
    As fer as we can tell,
    Sin frae the Eden o the world
    Ilka man in turn is hurled,
    And ilka gairden rins to waste
    That was ever to his taste?)

    _O keep the Thistle yont the wa
    Owre which your skeletons youll thraw._

    I, in the Thistles land,
    As you[13] in Russia where
    Struggle in giant form
    Proceeds for evermair,
    In my sma measure bood
    Address a similar task,
    And for a share o your
    Appallin genius ask. - number of characters: 809

_Maun I tae perish in the keel o Heaven,
    And is this fratt upon the air the ply
    O cross-brathd cordage that in gloffs and gowls
    Braks up the vision o the warlds bricht gy?_

    _Ships tackle and an eemis cairn o fraucht
    Darker than clamourin veins are roond me yet,
    A plait o shadows thicker than the flesh,
    A fank o tows that binds me hand and fit._

    _What gin the gorded fullyery on hie
    And a the fanerels o the michty ship
    Gie back mair licht than fas upon them evn
    Gin sic black ingangs haud us in their grip?_

    Grugous thistle, to my een
    Your widdifow ramel evince,
    Sibness to snakes whas coils
    Rin coonter airts at yince,
    And fain Id follow each
    Gin you the trickll teach. - number of characters: 763

But let my soul increase in me,
    God dwarfed to enter my puir thocht
    Expand to his true size again,
    And protoplasms look befit
    The nature o its destiny,
    And seed and sequence be nae mair
    Incongruous to ane anither,
    And liquor packed impossibly
    Mak pint-pot an eternal well,
    And art be relevant to life,
    And poets mair than dominies yet,
    And ends nae langer tint in means,
    Nor forests hidden by their trees,
    Nor men be sacrificed alive
    In foonds o fates designed for them,
    Nor mansions o the soul stand toom
    Their owners in their cellars trapped,
    Nor a a peoples genius be
    A rumple-fyke in Heavens doup,
    While Calvinism uses her
    To breed a minister or twa! - number of characters: 754

_Yank oot your orra boughs, my hert!_

    God gied man speech and speech created thocht,
    He gied man speech but to the Scots gied nocht
    Barrin this clytach that theyve never brocht
    To onything but sic a Blottie O
    As some bairns copybook micht show,

    A spook o soond that frae the unkent grave
    In which oor nation lies loups up to wave
    Sic leprous chuns as tatties have
    That cellar-boond send spindles gropin
    Towards ony hole thats open,

    Like waesome fingers in the dark that think
    They still may widen the ane and only chink
    That eer has gien mankind a blink
    O Hope—tho evn in that puir licht
    They sud hae seen their hopeless plicht. - number of characters: 709

Spirit o strife, destroy in turn
    Syne this fules Paradise, syne that;
    In thees in Calvaries that owrecome
    Daith efter Daith let me be caught,

    Or in the human form that hauds
    Us in its ignominious thrall,
    While on brute needs oor souls attend
    Until disease and daith end all,

    Or in the grey deluded brain,
    Reflectin in anither field
    The torments o its parent flesh
    In thocht-preventin thocht concealed,

    Or still in curst impossible mould,
    Last thistle-shape men think to tak,
    The soul, frae flesh and thocht set free,
    On Heavens strait if unseen rack. - number of characters: 631

As mithers aften think the warld
    O bairns that hae nae end or object,
    Or lovers think their sweethearts made
    Yince-yirn—wha haena waled the lave,
    Maikless—when they are naebody,
    Or men o ilka sort and kind
    Are prood o thochts they ca their ain,
    That nameless millions had afore
    And nameless millions yetll hae,
    And that were never worth the haen,
    Or Cruivies latest story or
    Gilsanquhars vows to sign the pledge,
    Ors if I thocht maist whisky _was_,
    Or failed to coont the cheenge I got,
    Sae wad I be gin I rejoiced,
    Or didna ken my place, in thee. - number of characters: 622
