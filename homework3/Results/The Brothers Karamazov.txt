They Carry Mitya Away


When the protocol had been signed, Nikolay Parfenovitch turned solemnly
to the prisoner and read him the Committal, setting forth, that in
such a year, on such a day, in such a place, the investigating lawyer
of such‐ and‐such a district court, having examined so‐and‐so (to wit,
Mitya) accused of this and of that (all the charges were carefully
written out) and having considered that the accused, not pleading
guilty to the charges made against him, had brought forward nothing in
his defense, while the witnesses, so‐and‐so, and so‐and‐so, and the
circumstances such‐and‐such testify against him, acting in accordance
with such‐and‐such articles of the Statute Book, and so on, has ruled,
that, in order to preclude so‐and‐ so (Mitya) from all means of evading
pursuit and judgment he be detained in such‐and‐such a prison, which he
hereby notifies to the accused and communicates a copy of this same
Committal to the deputy prosecutor, and so on, and so on. - number of characters: 1002

If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument
that those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly
from the books, and that we had to restore them and to invent them
anew, and to do so had gathered together all the wise men of the
earth—rulers, chief priests, learned men, philosophers, poets—and had
set them the task to invent three questions, such as would not only fit
the occasion, but express in three words, three human phrases, the
whole future history of the world and of humanity—dost Thou believe
that all the wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in
depth and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to
Thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness? - number of characters: 752

I believe like a child that suffering will be
healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of human
contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the despicable
fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidian mind of man,
that in the worlds finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, something
so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all hearts, for
the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all the crimes
of humanity, of all the blood theyve shed; that it will make it not
only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened with
men—but though all that may come to pass, I dont accept it. - number of characters: 672

On it lay Fyodor Pavlovitchs white silk
dressing‐gown, stained with blood; the fatal brass pestle with which
the supposed murder had been committed; Mityas shirt, with a
blood‐stained sleeve; his coat, stained with blood in patches over the
pocket in which he had put his handkerchief; the handkerchief itself,
stiff with blood and by now quite yellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at
Perhotins with a view to suicide, and taken from him on the sly at
Mokroe by Trifon Borissovitch; the envelope in which the three thousand
roubles had been put ready for Grushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with
which it had been tied, and many other articles I dont remember. - number of characters: 665

Gentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favorite of the dead mans,
tried to reply to some of the evil speakers that this is not held
everywhere alike, and that the incorruptibility of the bodies of the
just was not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only an opinion, and
that even in the most Orthodox regions, at Athos for instance, they
were not greatly confounded by the smell of corruption, and there the
chief sign of the glorification of the saved was not bodily
incorruptibility, but the color of the bones when the bodies have lain
many years in the earth and have decayed in it. - number of characters: 600

On his recovery, he clearly and
emphatically stated, in reply to our questions, that when, on coming
out to the steps, and hearing a noise in the garden, he made up his
mind to go into it through the little gate which stood open, before he
noticed you running, as you have told us already, in the dark from the
open window where you saw your father, he, Grigory, glanced to the
left, and, while noticing the open window, observed at the same time,
much nearer to him, the door, standing wide open—that door which you
have stated to have been shut the whole time you were in the garden. - number of characters: 593

And why could you not have explained things to her, and in
view of your position, which you describe as being so awful, why could
you not have had recourse to the plan which would so naturally have
occurred to ones mind, that is, after honorably confessing your errors
to her, why could you not have asked her to lend you the sum needed for
your expenses, which, with her generous heart, she would certainly not
have refused you in your distress, especially if it had been with some
guarantee, or even on the security you offered to the merchant
Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov? - number of characters: 587

When he was asked to explain how
it was apparent now at this moment, the old doctor, with simple‐hearted
directness, pointed out that the prisoner on entering the court had an
extraordinary air, remarkable in the circumstances; that he had
marched in like a soldier, looking straight before him, though it
would have been more natural for him to look to the left where, among
the public, the ladies were sitting, seeing that he was a great admirer
of the fair sex and must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying
of him now, the old man concluded in his peculiar language. - number of characters: 587

In the ordinary occasions of life, he said in the same complacent and
sententious tone in which he had taunted Grigory and argued with him
about religion at Fyodor Pavlovitchs table, in the ordinary occasions
of life, blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law, and people
have given them up, but in exceptional occasions of life people still
fly to blows, not only among us but all over the world, be it even the
fullest Republic of France, just as in the time of Adam and Eve, and
they never will leave off, but you, even in an exceptional case, did
not dare. - number of characters: 574

He was so good as to express the opinion that, if
I dont go in for the career of an archimandrite in the immediate
future and dont become a monk, I shall be sure to go to Petersburg and
get on to some solid magazine as a reviewer, that I shall write for the
next ten years, and in the end become the owner of the magazine, and
bring it out on the liberal and atheistic side, with a socialistic
tinge, with a tiny gloss of socialism, but keeping a sharp look out all
the time, that is, keeping in with both sides and hoodwinking the
fools. - number of characters: 546
