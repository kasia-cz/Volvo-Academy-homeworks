10 longest sentences by number of characters:

How much better it
is to understand it all, to recognise it all, all the impossibilities
and the stone wall; not to be reconciled to one of those
impossibilities and stone walls if it disgusts you to be reconciled to
it; by the way of the most inevitable, logical combinations to reach
the most revolting conclusions on the everlasting theme, that even for
the stone wall you are yourself somehow to blame, though again it is as
clear as day you are not to blame in the least, and therefore grinding
your teeth in silent impotence to sink into luxurious inertia, brooding
on the fact that there is no one even for you to feel vindictive
against, that you have not, and perhaps never will have, an object for
your spite, that it is a sleight of hand, a bit of juggling, a
card-sharpers trick, that it is simply a mess, no knowing what and no
knowing who, but in spite of all these uncertainties and jugglings,
still there is an ache in you, and the more you do not know, the worse
the ache. - number of characters: 1004

(Allow
me to make use of this word romantic—an old-fashioned and much
respected word which has done good service and is familiar to all.) The
characteristics of our romantic are to understand everything, _to see
everything and to see it often incomparably more clearly than our most
realistic minds see it;_ to refuse to accept anyone or anything, but at
the same time not to despise anything; to give way, to yield, from
policy; never to lose sight of a useful practical object (such as
rent-free quarters at the government expense, pensions, decorations),
to keep their eye on that object through all the enthusiasms and
volumes of lyrical poems, and at the same time to preserve the sublime
and the beautiful inviolate within them to the hour of their death,
and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious jewel
wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of the sublime and the
beautiful. - number of characters: 928

The fact is,
gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to
almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical)
there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which
we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than
all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready
to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason,
honour, peace, prosperity—in fact, in opposition to all those excellent
and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most
advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all. - number of characters: 636

What is more, he will talk to you with
excitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with irony
he will upbraid the short-sighted fools who do not understand their own
interests, nor the true significance of virtue; and, within a quarter
of an hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply through
something inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will
go off on quite a different tack—that is, act in direct opposition to
what he has just been saying about himself, in opposition to the laws
of reason, in opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition to
everything ... - number of characters: 629

Oh, tell me, who was it first
announced, who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things
because he does not know his own interests; and that if he were
enlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, man
would at once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good and
noble because, being enlightened and understanding his real advantage,
he would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else, and we all
know that not one man can, consciously, act against his own interests,
consequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good? - number of characters: 599

PART II
À Propos of the Wet Snow


When from dark errors subjugation
My words of passionate exhortation
    Had wrenched thy fainting spirit free;
And writhing prone in thine affliction
Thou didst recall with malediction
    The vice that had encompassed thee:
And when thy slumbering conscience, fretting
    By recollections torturing flame,
Thou didst reveal the hideous setting
    Of thy lifes current ere I came:
When suddenly I saw thee sicken,
    And weeping, hide thine anguished face,
Revolted, maddened, horror-stricken,
    At memories of foul disgrace. - number of characters: 583

I will explain; the enjoyment was
just from the too intense consciousness of ones own degradation; it
was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it
was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no
escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even
if time and faith were still left you to change into something
different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish
to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there
was nothing for you to change into. - number of characters: 559

But the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just
be that he is _predestined_ to make the road, and perhaps, too, that
however stupid the direct practical man may be, the thought sometimes
will occur to him that the road almost always does lead _somewhere_,
and that the destination it leads to is less important than the process
of making it, and that the chief thing is to save the well-conducted
child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal
idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices. - number of characters: 555

They express the consciousness that you have no enemy to
punish, but that you have pain; the consciousness that in spite of all
possible Wagenheims you are in complete slavery to your teeth; that if
someone wishes it, your teeth will leave off aching, and if he does
not, they will go on aching another three months; and that finally if
you are still contumacious and still protest, all that is left you for
your own gratification is to thrash yourself or beat your wall with
your fist as hard as you can, and absolutely nothing more. - number of characters: 541

And of course he knows himself that he is doing himself no
sort of good with his moans; he knows better than anyone that he is
only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows
that even the audience before whom he is making his efforts, and his
whole family, listen to him with loathing, do not put a haporth of
faith in him, and inwardly understand that he might moan differently,
more simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing
himself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy. - number of characters: 534
