The German Emperor, who was visiting our shores at the time, took
occasion to pay Miss Nightingale a very graceful compliment, by sending
her a bouquet of flowers, accompanied by the following letter from the
German Ambassador:

    DEAR MISS NIGHTINGALE,--His Majesty the Emperor, having just
    brought to a close a most enjoyable stay in the beautiful
    neighbourhood of your old home [Embley Park] near Romsey, has
    commanded me to present you with some flowers as a token of his
    esteem for the lady who, after receiving her education in nursing
    by the Sisters of Mercy at Kaiserswerth, on the Rhine, rendered
    such invaluable services to the cause of humanity during the
    Crimean War, and subsequently founded a house for the training
    of nurses in England, which is justly considered to be a model
    institution of European fame. - number of characters: 874
