10 longest sentences by number of characters:

Then, more full of passion than ever woman lover had ever been, and
enraptured as you listened to my voice, so completely beneath your sway,
listening only to your own love, you would raise your little coquettish
petticoat, and pressing dear little loves of calves more closely
together, for you could be on your knees, resting upon my little blue
veins, you would frig me in this manner, with greater vigour than ever
sitting down every now and then upon your fine little heels, in order
the better to release my beautiful prick, perfectly straight and rudely
swollen and inflamed with passionate desires, from between your divine
thighs, as soft as satin, and as white as snow, to better introduce the
wet tips of your lovely and velvet like bosoms into the seductive little
hole of my member, whilst my knees raised slightly behind would gently
caress your bottom, so as to give you some little satisfaction in your
turn; and at last, unable any longer to retard the moment of emission,
you would bend forward, resting upon both your hands, to increase my
desire, and keeping yourself back a little distance from me, while your
petticoats would now cover my head, and act almost like an electrical
conductor upon me, you would intoxicate me with the perfume exhaled from
your legs, from your member, from your cunt, from your bottom, and
lastly, you would slake my thirst and complete the celestial transport
by pissing, with eager rapture, between my burning lips some of that
womans nectar which you would alone possess, and which, emanating from
you alone in the world, is worthy of the gods. - number of characters: 1620

When I shall have undressed my adorable little mistress it will be nine
oclock, she will be mad with desire, delirious from passion and
rapturous exactions (exigencies), her maddening look exciting me in the
highest degree will arouse all the strength I possess, and enable me to
exhaust her so completely that she herself will attain the height of
happiness; the greater the refinement and delicacy of my caresses the
greater will be your happiness, the more languishing will your eyes
become, the more will your pretty mouth unclose itself, the more will
your tongue become agitated, the more will your bosoms, firm and soft as
velvet, become distended, and their nipples grow large, red, and
appetizing; then will your arms grow weaker and then will your angelic
legs open themselves in a voluptuous manner, and then seeing ourselves
reflected on all sides in the mirrors, shall I take you in my arms in
order to excite you (_branler_, frig) with my hand, whilst your little
rosy fingers will similarly excite me with vigour, and I shall suck your
divine nipples with passion. - number of characters: 1094

When the agitation of your little legs, of
your lovely little bottom (_derrière_), of your head, and those murmurs
of pleasure (_rugissements_) prove to me that you are at the point of
emission, I shall stop and carry you to a piece of furniture made to
sustain your head, your back, your bottom, and your legs, and having
near your cunt (_con_) an opening sufficiently wide to allow my body to
pass erect between your legs; then shall I fuck (_enfiler_) you with
frenzy with my enormous and long member, which will penetrate to the
mouth of your womb; being squeezed by your pretty legs, which will bring
me closer to you, I shall wriggle (_remuerai_) my strong pretty member,
which you love, with more vigour than ever; my private parts (_organes
mâles_, testicles) will touch your little bottom, and this contact will
provoke such an abundant flow of the essence of love in your little cunt
that I shall be as if I were in a bath. - number of characters: 946

The sweet Benson lent herself most readily to the work, and seconded us
by her art in wriggling her arse and the delicious cunt and sphincter
pressures; enjoying herself at once and more rapidly than the Egerton,
she got four delicious discharges before our somewhat more sluggish
senses would allow us to come to the grand final crisis, which seemed to
stimulate the divine Benson to a point of raving lust, which showed
itself in cries of the grossest bawdy; shouting to us to shove our
pricks in further and faster, calling us all the loudest blackguard
names she could put her tongue to—absolutely roaring as the final
discharge seized her in the very same instant that we poured floods of
sperm into both interiors, she then sank, annihilated by the excess of
the voluptuous delights conferred upon her, but lay throbbing and
pulsating in all the after-joys of the utmost venereal satisfaction. - number of characters: 911

From her love of my
splendid splitter, of which she had taken the first sweets, and which
had been initiated in her deliciously adulterous cunt into the divine
mysteries of love, and the still more sacred and secret joys of the
second altar dedicated to the worship of Priapean unutterably sensual
raptures; from this circumstance and the constant use of the rear
receptacle practised by her husband, whose prick was a very fine one,
the initiation into the _double jouissance_ was less nervously effected
than with the less used arsehole of the more delicate Egerton, but at
the same time two such pricks operating at once made her wince a little
before we were fairly engulphed to the cods, the banging together of
which in their close proximity added greatly to the stimulating of our
lust. - number of characters: 805

Of course, you and my dear wife between you will break her in to allow
of any action on my part; and, by the way, my dear, I would suggest that
you should surprise Charlie in the act, and tear them asunder in
pretended rage—that Charlie should seize you, and say he would make you
by force a participator in the act, on the pretence of shutting you up
for finding fault: you must break from his arms, and fly to your own
bed, he must catch you as you try to enter it, and push his great big
cock into you, on which you must cry for help, and call upon Ellen to
come to your succour; she will come, but I do not judge her right, if
she will not rather assist Charlie, by holding you, than otherwise. - number of characters: 707

my dear boy, it may be joy to you, but what a sorrow it will be
to me if such should be the case; think how I should lose position in
the world if it should be known, and even if by going abroad I could
hide my shame from the public, still what shifts and contrivances I
should be put to to ensure secrecy; but never mind, my darling, I would
run twice such risk to enjoy your person, and secure your affection; you
must ever cherish and love me, my Charlie, for I risk good name and fame
for you; but now I must be gone, or we shall be sought for; try and
sleep a little, my dear boy, for I am sure you need it after your
exertions, and remember you must gain strength to renew them this
night. - number of characters: 705

Miss Frankland herself became moved,
but proceeded at once to lay her across her lap, and began with gentle
switches, just sufficiently sharp to attract the blood in that
direction, which, of course, acted with double force on all the already
excited erotic organs, and Lizzie began to wriggle her bum in all the
lasciviousness of lust under the excited gaze of Miss Frankland, who,
seeing how matters were going on in her favour, increased the force of
her blows, but only sufficiently to still more lecherously excite her
patient—until, driven to an excess of lust, she cried out—

Oh, my loved Miss Frankland, I am dying with pleasure, do embrace and
caress me. - number of characters: 675

Then her belly, undulating so enticingly, and
swelling out, the lowest part into a very fine and prominent mons
Veneris, covered with a thick crop of silky and curly light hair; then
the entrance to the grotto of Venus had such delicious pouting lips,
rosy, but with hair still thick on each side, which is often not the
case even with women who have a sufficient tuft above, how beautiful
where it exists as it did in this charming and perfect woman, continuing
in beautiful little curls not only down to but around her lovely pinky
and puckered little bottom-hole, the delights of which I had already, in
this infancy of my love education, tasted and enjoyed. - number of characters: 670

He used to turn to
her, waken her up with a shake, cry out, _Marietta, porgemi il vaso
generative_ (Marietta, reach me the generative vase), upon which she
stretched herself on her back, he got on her without lifting her
petticoats or feeling her cunt, but opening the slit, pointed his prick
to her cunt, thrust it up to the hilt, and being himself in want of
spermatic relief, in a very few strokes spent, just staying in long
enough to piss all his tallow, and then withdraw, turning his back
again to sleep, leaving his wife just sufficiently excited to have
enjoyed it, and thus left her madly longing for the satisfaction he did
not afford. - number of characters: 656
