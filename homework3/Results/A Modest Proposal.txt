10 longest sentences by number of characters:

And secondly,
There being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout
this kingdom, whose whole subsistence put into a common stock, would
leave them in debt two million of pounds sterling, adding those who are
beggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers and labourers,
with their wives and children, who are beggars in effect; I desire
those politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold
to attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these
mortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness
to have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I prescribe,
and thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they
have since gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the
impossibility of paying rent without money or trade, the want of common
sustenance, with neither house nor clothes to cover them from the
inclemencies of the weather, and the most inevitable prospect of
intailing the like, or greater miseries, upon their breed for ever. - number of characters: 1059

Therefore let no man talk to me of
other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of
using neither clothes, nor houshold furniture, except what is of our
own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and
instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of
pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein
of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country,
wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants of
Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any
longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment
their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our
country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at
least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. - number of characters: 858

But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient
was put into his head by the famous Psalmanaazor, a native of the
island Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago,
and in conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young
person happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to
persons of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body
of a plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison
the Emperor, was sold to his imperial majestys prime minister of
state, and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the
gibbet, at four hundred crowns. - number of characters: 663

For we can neither
employ them in handicraft or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I
mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a
livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where
they are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments
much earlier; during which time they can however be properly looked
upon only as probationers; as I have been informed by a principal
gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never
knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of
the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art. - number of characters: 655

Infants flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more
plentiful in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a
grave author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick
dyet, there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about
nine months after Lent, than at any other season; therefore, reckoning
a year after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because
the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom,
and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening
the number of Papists among us. - number of characters: 601

It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be
supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment:
at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may
certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of
begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide
for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their
parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of
their lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding,
and partly to the clothing of many thousands. - number of characters: 585

I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of
children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their
mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable
state of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore
whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these
children sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so
well of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of
the nation. - number of characters: 502

For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the
number of Papists, with whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal
breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who
stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the
Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many
good Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than
stay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal
curate. - number of characters: 499

For instance, the addition
of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barreld beef: the
propagation of swines flesh, and improvement in the art of making good
bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs, too
frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or
magnificence to a well grown, fat yearling child, which roasted whole
will make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayors feast, or any other
publick entertainment. - number of characters: 466

I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the
hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand
may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males;
which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my
reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a
circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will
be sufficient to serve four females. - number of characters: 461
