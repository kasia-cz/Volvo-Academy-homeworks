 Chapter I. - number of characters: 1090

Had this been all, it might not, perhaps, have greatly signified; for
when the lower classes alone complained, the court of France, separated
as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and
the _bourgeoisie_, seldom listened to their voice; but unluckily,
Mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold
no less than twelve appointments in the Court of Requests, at a high
price; and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their
places, and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily
lower the value of each place, the old functionaries formed a union
amongst themselves, and, enraged, swore on the Bible not to allow of
this addition to their number, but to resist all the persecutions which
might ensue; and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by
this resistance, to combine to indemnify him for his loss. - number of characters: 904

laughed the apparition, every gentleman seems to have the
same fancy, for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad, well mounted
like you, as tall as you and of about your age, halted before this
clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here, and
dined here, with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor, upon a
pie, of which they havent left a mouthful, and two bottles of Macon
wine, of which they havent left a drop, but fortunately we have still
some of the same wine and some of the same pies left, and if your
worship will but give your orders——

No, friend, replied Raoul, smiling, I am obliged to you, but at this
moment I want nothing but the things for which I have asked—only I
shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good; upon these
conditions I will pay for the pen the price of the bottle, and for the
ink the price of the pie. - number of characters: 890

In truth, that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no
longer, was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which
seemed, as we have observed, more appropriate to a phantom than a
living creature—from the corridors deserted by courtiers, and courts
crowded with guards—from that spirit of bitter ridicule, which, arising
from the streets below, penetrated through the very casements of the
room, which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against
the minister; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns
firing—let off, happily, without other end or aim, except to show to
the guards, the Swiss troops and the military who surrounded the Palais
Royal, that the people were possessed of arms. - number of characters: 754

I speak of that spiteful and intriguing Italian—of the pedant
who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under
a pillow—of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king—who
wants to send the princes of the blood to prison, not daring to kill
them, as our great cardinal—our cardinal did—of the miser, who weighs
his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear, though he is rich,
of losing them at play next morning—of the impudent fellow who insults
the queen, as they say—so much the worse for her—and who is going in
three months to make war upon us, in order that he may retain his
pensions; is that the master whom you propose to me? - number of characters: 683

But when Aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light—that is
to say, with all its advantages; when he had pointed out to her, in
exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of Paris, the
viceroyalty of Font-de-lArche, in other words, of all Normandy; when
he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by
the cardinal; when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on
her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font, Madame de
Longueville contended no longer, except as is the custom with pretty
women to contend, and defended herself only to surrender at last. - number of characters: 624

Oh, father, continued the executioner, without opening his eyes, as
if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object, it is
especially when night comes on and when I have to cross a river, that
this terror which I have been unable to conquer comes upon me; it then
seems as if my hand grew heavy, as if the cutlass was still in its
grasp, as if the water had the color of blood, and all the voices of
nature—the whispering of the trees, the murmur of the wind, the lapping
of the wave—united in a voice tearful, despairing, terrible, crying to
me, Place for the justice of God! - number of characters: 594

Athos, with his superior understanding,
wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and
satisfactory point of reunion, and at the moment when his friends, in
deference to his deportment and sobriety, dared scarcely speak of some
of their former good dinners, he was the first to propose that they
should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon
themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners—a
freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good
understanding between them which gave them the name of the
inseparables. - number of characters: 588

This amusement lasted from the Barriere des Sergens to the place of
Notre Dame, and Friquet found in it very real enjoyment; but when at
last the regiment separated, penetrated the heart of the city and
placed itself at the extremity of the Rue Saint Christophe, near the
Rue Cocatrix, in which Broussel lived, then Friquet remembered that he
had not had breakfast; and after thinking in which direction he had
better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the
day, he reflected deeply and decided that Councillor Broussel should
bear the cost of this repast. - number of characters: 588

In one was depicted the Illustrious Coxcomb
receiving a shower of blows from Cardinal Bentivoglio, whose servant he
had been; another, the Illustrious Mazarin acting the part of
Ignatius Loyola in a tragedy of that name; a third, the Illustrious
Mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from Monsieur de
Chavigny, who had expected to have it; a fourth, the Illustrious
Coxcomb Mazarin refusing to give Laporte, the young kings valet,
clean sheets, and saving that it was quite enough for the king of
France to have clean sheets every three months. - number of characters: 563
