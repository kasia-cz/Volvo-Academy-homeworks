This tendency
would be also probably aided by the fact that in Homer, as Plutarch
points out, and in the dramatists and prose writers generally, as is
well known, the designations of gods and dæmons were mutually
interchanged.[243] Plutarch, at all events, who boldly uses the Dæmons
to perform such functions, and to bear the blame for such actions, as
were inappropriate to the divine character, is enabled to make one of
his _dramatis personæ_—Cleombrotus, the traveller, who was specially
devoted to the study of such matters—assert that it can be demonstrated
by unexceptionable testimony from antiquity that there do exist beings
of a nature intermediate between that of God and man, beings subject
to mortal passions and liable to inevitable changes, but whom we must,
_in accordance with the established custom of our fathers_, regard and
invoke as Dæmons, giving them all due reverence.[244] It is natural,
therefore, in the light of these indications, to believe that, side by
side with the popular gods, there existed, in the popular imagination,
subordinate beings of two kinds, both described as Dæmons: the first
class comprising the good and benevolent Dæmons of Hesiod, the second
including Dæmons of an evil character and disposition, the belief in
which had developed naturally out of the Hesiodic conception, from the
necessity of fixing the responsibility of evil deeds on supernatural
beings different in nature from the purity and goodness of Deity.[245]
Such a classification of supernatural beings—gods, Dæmons, and evil
Dæmons—could not, of course, be rigidly maintained; the more the good
Dæmons were discriminated from their evil brethren, the more they would
tend to become identified with the gods of the popular tradition, and the
line of demarcation between the divine and the dæmonic nature would be
broken down,[246] Dæmons and gods would be identified, and the splendour
and purity of the Supreme God of all would shine out more fully when
contrasted with those other gods, who, after all, were only Dæmons. - number of characters: 2070

Their method was wrong, according to the Magna Moralia,
since there is a special and appropriate method for the analysis and
discussion of the virtues, and Justice is not a number evenly even.[66]
Such a definition, thus crushed by way of a point-blank negative, has,
of course, nothing but a metaphorical significance as applied to Ethics;
but the metaphorical conception of Justice as a perfect number will
not be totally devoid of inspiration to justice of conduct in the mind
of one who loves perfection even when represented by an arithmetical
abstraction; and if by this definition it was designed to express the
correspondence between action and suffering,[67] a fruitful, though
incomplete, ethical principle is embodied in their mathematical
phrasing.[68] In a more general sense, Epicharmus has sung how the
Pythagorean Doctrine of Number may be applied to the domain of practice:—

    Mans life needs greatly Numbers ordered sway:
    His path is safe who follows Numbers way.[69]

But the Pythagorean doctrine of Transmigration probably had a greater
ethical value than the metaphysical conceptions of Number which
constituted the Pythagorean οὐσία; although it is not impossible that
the dogma, when carelessly held or unphilosophically interpreted, might
have a vicious rather than a virtuous effect.[70] The Golden Verses of
Pythagoras, whether composed by any individual member of the school,
or officially embodying the teaching of the sect, or representing the
actual work of some philosopher not formally a Pythagorean, have been
universally recognised to express a Pythagorean ideal;[71] and thus
exhibit in the doctrine of the Italian School a far more vigorous and
fruitful ethical tendency than any study of its official doctrines—so far
as they are available for study—would lead us to suppose. - number of characters: 1847

Persius, whose disposition was marked by maidenly
modesty and gentleness, and who is also described as _frugi et pudicus_,
shows, even when hampered by a disjointed style which only allows him to
utter his thought in fragments, that devotion to the highest moral aims
which we should expect from a writer brought up under the influences
which he enjoyed;[113] and though he, too, exhibits some of the savage
ferocity of Juvenal in his strictures of vice, he yet pays, in his Fifth
Satire, that tribute to virtue in the person of Cornutus which proves
the goodness of the writer and the gracefulness with which he could
write.[114] Lucan, too, whose youth, like that of Persius, had the
inestimable advantage of receiving a share of the wisdom which Cornutus
had gained by nights devoted to philosophic studies, exhibits a spirit
of the loftiest morality under the rhetorical phrasing of his great
Republican Epic.[115] Looking back, with something of regret, to the days
of a dominant oligarchy, he does not conceal the licentiousness which
society harboured beneath the sway of the later Optimates, and he turns
mostly to Cato as the type which he would fain accept as representative
of the true Roman patrician:—

    Nam cui crediderim Superos arcana daturos
    Dicturosque magis quam sancto vera Catoni?[116]

The noble lines in which Cato refuses to consult the Libyan oracle—_Non
exploratum populis Ammona relinquens_—are well known, and express a
highly ethical view of the divine administration of the world:—

    Hæremus cuncti superis, temploque tacente
    Nil facimus non sponte Dei: nec vocibus ullis
    Numen agit: dixitque semel nascentibus auctor
    Quicquid scire licet: steriles nec legit arenas
    Ut caneret paucis, mersitque hoc pulvere verum. - number of characters: 1799

He
alludes coldly, perhaps even sneeringly, to such of his contemporaries
as fancied they could apply the ancient traditions of glory to those
late and unseasonable times, like little children who would try to
wear their fathers sandals;[162] counsels a complete submission to
the duly appointed Roman authorities; fully persuaded that within the
limits of their supremacy there is as much freedom as a reasonable man
could desire to enjoy; and honestly claims to find scope, in a little
Bœotian township, for such political ambition as could be safely and
wisely indulged.[163] It is not difficult to sneer at the prudential
limitation of patriotism to such petty, insignificant, and meagre efforts
as the superintendence of bricks and mortar and the carting of municipal
rubbish; but the wiser thing is to note that Plutarchs opposition to
vain fancies of the revival of the ancient Hellenic splendour, except
perhaps in such a form as a Hadrian might be inclined to revive it in
an artificial Panhellenium, is based on the conviction that happiness
depends upon the free development of individual character, the
unrestricted enjoyment of domestic peace, the undisturbed intercourse
of social life; and he knew that the Roman sway made it possible, for
Greeks at any rate, to enjoy these blessings to a degree never previously
known in their chequered history.[164] With a clear recognition of the
historical causes of the political decadence of Hellenism, he regards
civic discord as the evil which most demands the attention of those
who still seek opportunities for public action, and he is particularly
grateful to the strong hand of Rome for controlling the internecine
animosities of Greek cities. - number of characters: 1730

Christian translators of the piece, from
Amyot down to the writers just quoted, have hailed it as an effective
vindication of the ways of God to man, and Comte Joseph de Maistre, whose
paraphrase is designed, as he says, to please ladies and foreigners,
is quite convinced that such a justification could not possibly have
been written by one who was not a Christian.[202] Even Wyttenbach, whom
de Maistre attacks for repudiating this view, is willing, with all his
scholarly caution, to admit that Plutarch, in this tract, touches the
excellences of the Christian faith.[203]

The position which Plutarch sets himself to overthrow is that which is
expressed most concisely in the famous verses of Ennius:—

    Ego deum genus esse semper dixi et dicam cœlitum,
    Sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus;
    Nam si curent, bene bonis sit, male malis, quod nunc abest

—a sentiment in exact harmony with the Epicurean view of the matter.[204]
While, however, establishing the providence and goodness of God as
against the practical Atheism of the Epicureans, it will be seen that he
is equally temperate, and equally consistent with himself, in avoiding
the exaggerated zeal of those Stoics who, in their eager desire to do
something for the honour of Providence, had subjected the minutest
and commonest actions of life to the jealous watching of an arbitrary
omniscience, so that, as Wyttenbach puts it, that most gracious name
of Providence was exposed to ridicule and contempt, being alternately
regarded as a _fortune-telling old crone_, and as _a dreadful spectre to
alarm and terrify mankind_. - number of characters: 1639

Self-knowledge, which is alien to the multitude, who are
under the sway of the poets,[59] is already, in Heraclitus, the basis of
self-control, as it is in Socrates the basis of all moral excellence.[60]
An ordered self-control is the highest of all virtues; even the Sun must
not transgress the limits of his sphere, or the Erinnyes, the Ministers
of _Justice_, will find him out.[61] Anaxagoras, whom Sextus Empiricus
will one day describe as the most _physical_ of all the philosophers,
began his book on Nature with the words All things were in confusion
together; then came Intelligence, and gave them order and arrangement;
thus laying the foundation of his Natural Philosophy in a principle which
could not fail of early application to the sphere of Conduct.[62] The
denial of blind Chance, or of immutable Fate, in the realm of physical
phenomena easily leads to its repudiation in the sphere of Ethics, and to
a recognition of the personal responsibility of the individual mind for
the consequences of its own decisions.[63] It was probably a conviction
of the ethical fruitfulness of the principle thus laid down by Anaxagoras
in the sphere of Physics which induced Aristotle, the greatest of all
ethical philosophers, to assert that its author, as compared with his
predecessors, was a sober thinker by the side of random babblers.[64] The
physical investigations of Democritus were utilized by the Epicureans
to free man from superstitious fears of another world, in order that he
might direct all his powers to making the best of this world, in a moral,
infinitely more than in a physical, sense. - number of characters: 1631

This ill-harmonizing combination of metaphysics and popular belief
is further placed in contact with views originated by Oriental creeds,
with Zoroastrianism, with Manichæism, with certain slight and obscure
hints of the truth, which are to be found scattered here and there in
Egyptian Mythology,[172] the whole presenting a strange conglomeration,
which appears to defy any attempt to make a consistent theology of it,
until we see Plutarchs method conspicuously emerging with its twofold
aim, of proving that all these different views of God are merely
different ways of striving after belief in the same Supreme Power, and
of inculcating a sympathetic and liberal attitude of mind, which is far
more conducive to unity than a detailed agreement on points of minor
importance.[173] This endeavour after unity is supported by a strenuous
and sincere belief in what at first sight appears to be a principle of
diversity—the belief, namely, in Dæmons—but which Plutarch uses to great
effect in his attempts after unity, by assigning, with Pythagoras,[174]
every recognized tradition unworthy of the Highest to these subordinate
beings whose influence is everywhere felt in nature and in human life,
and whose presence, at any rate, interpenetrates and overruns the whole
of Plutarchs views on religion.[175]

It is no unfitting circumstance in a priest of Apollo that his noblest
utterances respecting the nature of God should be contained in
discourses connected more or less with the temples and traditions of
the god. - number of characters: 1543

The ancient doctrine
of Dæmons, emanating from some obscure source in Antiquity,[233] had
been adopted by the Pythagoreans in the latter sense,[234] while Plato,
who believed in none of these things, had, on one or two occasions, by
the use of philosophic myth replete with more than Socratic irony,
described these beings as playing a part between God and man which might
be tolerantly regarded as not greatly dissimilar from that popularly
assigned to the lesser deities of the Hellenic Olympus.[235] In the
Statesman, the creation-myth, to which the Stranger invites the
younger Socrates to give his entire attention, like a child to a story,
describes how the Deity himself tended men and was their protector,
while Dæmons had a share, after the manner of shepherds, in the
superintendence of animals according to genera and herds.[236] Another
story which Socrates, in the Banquet, says that he heard from Diotima,
that wonderful person who postponed the Athenian plague for ten years,
tells how Eros is a great Dæmon; how Dæmons are intermediate between
gods and mortals; how the race of Dæmons interpret and transmit to the
gods the prayers and sacrifices of men, and interpret and transmit to
men the answers and commands of the gods.[237] For God, we are told, is
not directly associated with man; but it is through the mediation of the
Dæmons, who are many and various, that all communion and converse take
place between the human and the Divine. - number of characters: 1477

In the Isis and Osiris, for example,
he argues for the probability of the view which assigns the legends of
these two deities not to gods or men, but to Dæmons;[258] and proceeds
still further to breach the partition wall between the two natures by
introducing into his Dæmonology such legends as have raised Osiris and
Isis, on account of their virtue, from the rank of good Dæmons to that of
the gods,[259] and describes them as receiving everywhere the combined
honours of gods and Dæmons; and he appropriates the argument to Greek
religion by comparing this promotion to those of Herakles and Dionysus;
by identifying Isis with Proserpine, and subsequently Osiris with
Dionysus.[260]

But whatever may have been the views explicitly maintained by Plutarch in
this connexion, it is his constant practice to shift on to the shoulders
of the Dæmons the responsibility for all those legends, ceremonies, and
practices, which, however appropriate and necessary parts of the national
faith they may be, are yet inconsistent with the qualities rightly
attributable to Deity.[261] We have already noticed his unwillingness
to impugn the immutability of the Creator by regarding His essence as
capable of metamorphosis into the phenomena of the created world.[262]
It is, says Ammonius, the function of some other god to do and suffer
these changes—or, rather, of some Dæmon appointed to direct Nature in
the processes of generation and destruction. - number of characters: 1466

Because it
excluded Dialectics, and because it was excluded from Politics, the
gospel of the Garden established an ideal of homely virtue which lay
within the reach of the average man, who, like Epicurus himself, was
repelled by Platos distance from life, and did not feel called upon to
cherish impracticable schemes of ameliorating society under the dominion
of a Demetrius the Liberator, but was willing to content himself with a
humbler range of duty, with being temperate and chaste in his habits,
simple and healthy in his tastes, cheerful and serene in his personal
bearing, amiable and sympathetic with his friends, and cultivating
courteous relations in those slightly more extended social circles where
comity and tact take the place of the more intimate and familiar virtues
of household life.[93]

By the method of placing in continuous order certain common and
well-known indications, we have endeavoured to illustrate the view that
the natural development of Greek Philosophy led in the direction of
Ethics, and that the natural development of Ethics led in the direction
of a popular scheme of conduct, which, fragmentary and incomplete as
it might be in a scientific sense, had yet the advantage that it was
founded upon the common daily life of the ordinary man, and placed before
the ordinary man in his common daily life an ideal of virtue which, by
efforts not beyond his strength, he might realize and maintain. - number of characters: 1454
