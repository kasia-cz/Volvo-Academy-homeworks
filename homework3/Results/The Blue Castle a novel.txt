The
yellow-painted floor, with one hideous, hooked rug by the bed, with a
grotesque, hooked dog on it, always grinning at her when she awoke;
the faded, dark-red paper; the ceiling discoloured by old leaks and
crossed by cracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; the
brown-paper lambrequin with purple roses on it; the spotted old
looking-glass with the crack across it, propped up on the inadequate
dressing-table; the jar of ancient potpourri made by her mother in her
mythical honeymoon; the shell-covered box, with one burst corner, which
Cousin Stickles had made in her equally mythical girlhood; the beaded
pincushion with half its bead fringe gone; the one stiff, yellow chair;
the faded old motto, Gone but not forgotten, worked in coloured yarns
about Great-grand-mother Stirlings grim old face; the old photographs
of ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below. - number of characters: 898

THE BLUE CASTLE




CHAPTER I


If it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirlings whole
life would have been entirely different. - number of characters: 860

Aunt Isabel would remember that she had always said Doss looked like a
girl who would have heart trouble—so pinched and peaked always; and
Uncle Wellington would take it as a personal insult, when no Stirling
ever had heart disease before; and Georgiana would forebode in
perfectly audible asides that poor, dear little Doss isnt long for
this world, Im afraid; and Cousin Gladys would say, Why, _my_ heart
has been like that for _years_, in a tone that implied no one else had
any business even to have a heart; and Olive—Olive would merely look
beautiful and superior and disgustingly healthy, as if to say, Why all
this fuss over a faded superfluity like Doss when you have _me_? - number of characters: 691

Valancy saw straight black hair,
short and thin, always lustreless despite the fact that she gave it one
hundred strokes of the brush, neither more nor less, every night of her
life and faithfully rubbed Redferns Hair Vigor into the roots, more
lustreless than ever in its morning roughness; fine, straight, black
brows; a nose she had always felt was much too small even for her
small, three-cornered, white face; a small, pale mouth that always fell
open a trifle over little, pointed white teeth; a figure thin and
flat-breasted, rather below the average height. - number of characters: 573

Frogs, little green wizards of swamp and pool, singing everywhere
in the long twilights and long into the nights; islands fairy-like in a
green haze; the evanescent beauty of wild young trees in early leaf;
frost-like loveliness of the new foliage of juniper-trees; the woods
putting on a fashion of spring flowers, dainty, spiritual things akin
to the soul of the wilderness; red mist on the maples; willows decked
out with glossy silver pussies; all the forgotten violets of Mistawis
blooming again; lure of April moons. - number of characters: 529

And when the
specialists could do nothing for her Uncle James would insist on her
taking Purple Pills—Ive known them to effect a cure when _all_ the
doctors had given up—and her mother would insist on Redferns Blood
Bitters, and Cousin Stickles would insist on rubbing her over the heart
every night with Redferns Liniment on the grounds that it _might_ do
good and _couldnt_ do harm; and everybody else would have some pet
dope for her to take. - number of characters: 452

Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and
fire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps,
with great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up
and down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell
and nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that
reflected only handsome knights and lovely women—herself the loveliest
of all, for whose glance men died. - number of characters: 445

In the long, wondrous, northern twilights, when Cissy
was asleep and Roaring Abel away, she could sit for hours on the shaky
back verandah steps, looking out over the barrens to the hills beyond,
covered with their fine, purple bloom, listening to the friendly wind
singing wild, sweet melodies in the little spruces, and drinking in the
aroma of the sunned grasses, until darkness flowed over the landscape
like a cool, welcome wave. - number of characters: 440

We must go to them
lovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn what
poignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervals,
lying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music are
harped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate
savours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp
brooklands, what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt
them. - number of characters: 438

She had always hoped he did, but sometimes
she had a little, disagreeable, haunting dread that he was just kind
and nice and chummy out of pity; knowing that she hadnt long to live
and determined she should have a good time as long as she did live; but
away back in his mind rather looking forward to freedom again, with no
intrusive woman creature in his island fastness and no chattering thing
beside him in his woodland prowls. - number of characters: 436
