HELL
OR THE INFERNO




CANTO I


In the midway of this our mortal life,
I found me in a gloomy wood, astray
Gone from the path direct: and een to tell
It were no easy task, how savage wild
That forest, how robust and rough its growth,
Which to remember only, my dismay
Renews, in bitterness not far from death. - number of characters: 1482

CANTO XXIV


In the years early nonage, when the sun
Tempers his tresses in Aquarius urn,
And now towards equal day the nights recede,
When as the rime upon the earth puts on
Her dazzling sisters image, but not long
Her milder sway endures, then riseth up
The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,
And looking out beholds the plain around
All whitend, whence impatiently he smites
His thighs, and to his hut returning in,
There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,
As a discomfited and helpless man;
Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope
Spring in his bosom, finding een thus soon
The world hath changd its countnance, grasps his crook,
And forth to pasture drives his little flock:
So me my guide disheartend when I saw
His troubled forehead, and so speedily
That ill was curd; for at the fallen bridge
Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,
He turnd him back, as that I first beheld
At the steep mountains foot. - number of characters: 952

CANTO XXX


What time resentment burnd in Junos breast
For Semele against the Theban blood,
As more than once in dire mischance was rued,
Such fatal frenzy seizd on Athamas,
That he his spouse beholding with a babe
Laden on either arm, Spread out, he cried,
The meshes, that I take the lioness
And the young lions at the pass: then forth
Stretchd he his merciless talons, grasping one,
One helpless innocent, Learchus namd,
Whom swinging down he dashd upon a rock,
And with her other burden self-destroyd
The hapless mother plungd: and when the pride
Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,
By fortune overwhelmd, and the old king
With his realm perishd, then did Hecuba,
A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw
Polyxena first slaughterd, and her son,
Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach
Next met the mourners view, then reft of sense
Did she run barking even as a dog;
Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul. - number of characters: 949

CANTO XIII


Let him, who would conceive what now I saw,
Imagine (and retain the image firm,
As mountain rock, the whilst he hears me speak),
Of stars fifteen, from midst the ethereal host
Selected, that, with lively ray serene,
Oercome the massiest air: thereto imagine
The wain, that, in the bosom of our sky,
Spins ever on its axle night and day,
With the bright summit of that horn which swells
Due from the pole, round which the first wheel rolls,
T have rangd themselves in fashion of two signs
In heavn, such as Ariadne made,
When deaths chill seized her; and that one of them
Did compass in the others beam; and both
In such sort whirl around, that each should tend
With opposite motion and, conceiving thus,
Of that true constellation, and the dance
Twofold, that circled me, he shall attain
As t were the shadow; for things there as much
Surpass our usage, as the swiftest heavn
Is swifter than the Chiana. - number of characters: 939

The spirit, who
Thereof was questiond, did acquit him thus:
I know not: but tis fitting well the name
Should perish of that vale; for from the source
Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep
Maimd of Pelorus, (that doth scarcely pass
Beyond that limit,) even to the point
Whereunto ocean is restord, what heaven
Drains from th exhaustless store for all earths streams,
Throughout the space is virtue worried down,
As twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe,
Or through disastrous influence on the place,
Or else distortion of misguided wills,
That custom goads to evil: whence in those,
The dwellers in that miserable vale,
Nature is so transformd, it seems as they
Had shard of Circes feeding. - number of characters: 711

When, singing thus,
Those burning suns that circled round us thrice,
As nearest stars around the fixed pole,
Then seemd they like to ladies, from the dance
Not ceasing, but suspense, in silent pause,
Listning, till they have caught the strain anew:
Suspended so they stood: and, from within,
Thus heard I one, who spake: Since with its beam
The grace, whence true love lighteth first his flame,
That after doth increase by loving, shines
So multiplied in thee, it leads thee up
Along this ladder, down whose hallowd steps
None eer descend, and mount them not again,
Who from his phial should refuse thee wine
To slake thy thirst, no less constrained were,
Than water flowing not unto the sea. - number of characters: 707

Soon as the place
Receives her, round the plastic virtue beams,
Distinct as in the living limbs before:
And as the air, when saturate with showers,
The casual beam refracting, decks itself
With many a hue; so here the ambient air
Weareth that form, which influence of the soul
Imprints on it; and like the flame, that where
The fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth
The new form on the spirit follows still:
Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow calld,
With each sense even to the sight endued:
Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs
Which thou mayst oft have witnessd on the mount
Th obedient shadow fails not to present
Whatever varying passion moves within us. - number of characters: 700

If in one band
Collected, stood the people all, who eer
Pourd on Apulias happy soil their blood,
Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war
When of the rings the measurd booty made
A pile so high, as Romes historian writes
Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt
The grinding force of Guiscards Norman steel,
And those the rest, whose bones are gatherd yet
At Ceperano, there where treachery
Branded th Apulian name, or where beyond
Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms
The old Alardo conquerd; and his limbs
One were to show transpiercd, another his
Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this
Were but a thing of nought, to the hideous sight
Of the ninth chasm. - number of characters: 680

CANTO XXIII


Een as the bird, who midst the leafy bower
Has, in her nest, sat darkling through the night,
With her sweet brood, impatient to descry
Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,
In the fond quest unconscious of her toil:
She, of the time prevenient, on the spray,
That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze
Expects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,
Removeth from the east her eager ken;
So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance
Wistfully on that region, where the sun
Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her
Suspense and wandring, I became as one,
In whom desire is wakend, and the hope
Of somewhat new to come fills with delight. - number of characters: 676

I for thy profit pondring now devise,
That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide
Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,
Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see
Spirits of old tormented, who invoke
A second death; and those next view, who dwell
Content in fire, for that they hope to come,
Wheneer the time may be, among the blest,
Into whose regions if thou then desire
T ascend, a spirit worthier than I
Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,
Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,
Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,
Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,
That to his city none through me should come. - number of characters: 653
