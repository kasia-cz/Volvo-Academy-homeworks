10 longest sentences by number of characters:

Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsbys
house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all

contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the
last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for
wonder. - number of characters: 422

Gatsbys shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsbys
head for one link. - number of characters: 399

change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the
same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave
here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,
joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,

in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this years
shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely
withered. - number of characters: 370
