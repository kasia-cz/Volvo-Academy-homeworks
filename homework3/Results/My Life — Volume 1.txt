10 longest sentences by number of characters:

Just at that time I happened to be
in a position to give some correct details regarding this apparent
sacrifice on the part of Mendelssohn, because when I had made a serious
proposal to our general management about increasing the salaries of
several of the poorer members of the orchestra, Lüttichau was requested
to inform me that, according to the Kings latest commands, the
expenditure on the state bands was to be so restricted that for the
present the poorer chamber musicians could not claim any consideration,
for Herr von Falkenstein, the governor of the Leipzig district, who was
a passionate admirer of Mendelssohns, had gone so far as to influence
the King to appoint the latter secret conductor, with a secret salary
of six thousand marks. - number of characters: 762

A
fair-haired German of ancient Swabian stock, heir to the Norman realm
of Sicily and Naples, who gave the Italian language its first
development, and laid a basis for the evolution of knowledge and art
where hitherto ecclesiastical fanaticism and feudal brutality had alone
contended for power, a monarch who gathered at his court the poets and
sages of eastern lands, and surrounded himself with the living products
of Arabian and Persian grace and spirit—this man I beheld betrayed by
the Roman clergy to the infidel foe, yet ending his crusade, to their
bitter disappointment, by a pact of peace with the Sultan, from whom he
obtained a grant of privileges to Christians in Palestine such as the
bloodiest victory could scarcely have secured. - number of characters: 757

When in the evening we had
supped off trout at the Wilhelmsburg, drunk good Czernosek wine with
Bilin water, and duly excited ourselves over Hoffmann, Beethoven,
Shakespeare, Heinses Ardinghello, and other matters, and then, with
our limbs comfortably outstretched in our elegant carriage, drove back
in the summer twilight to the King of Prussia, where we occupied the
large balcony-room on the first floor, we felt that we had spent the
day like young gods, and for sheer exuberance could think of nothing
better to do than to indulge in the most frightful quarrels which,
especially when the windows were open, would collect numbers of alarmed
listeners in the square before the inn. - number of characters: 696

To this end I had to note
down the amount of my debts; but as I soon discovered that the
necessary sum could only be assigned to me as a loan from the Theatre
Pension Fund, at an interest of five per cent., and that I should
moreover have to secure the capital of the Pension Fund by a life
insurance policy, which would cost me annually three per cent, of the
capital borrowed, I was, for obvious reasons, tempted to leave out of
my petition all those of my debts which were not of a pressing nature,
and for the payment of which I thought I could count on the receipts
which I might finally expect from my publishing enterprises. - number of characters: 640

To explain
his views about the fatal mistake of trying to succeed as a dramatic
composer after Spontini, he began by praising me in these terms:
_Quand jai entendu votre Rienzi, jai dit, cest un homme de génie,
mais déjà il a plus fait quil ne peut faire._ In order to show me
what he meant by this paradox, he proceeded as follows: _Après Gluck
cest moi qui ai fait la grande révolution avec la_ Vestale; _jai
introduit le_ Vorhalt _de la sexte_ (the suspension of the sixth)
_dans lharmonie et la grosse caisse dans lorchestre; avec_ Cortez
_jai fait un pas de plus en avant; puis jai fait trois pas avec_
Olympic. - number of characters: 626

Nurmahal, Alcidor _et tout ce que jai fait dans les premiers
temps à Berlin, je vous les livre, cétaient des œuvres occasionnelles;
mais depuis jai fait cent pas en avant avec_ Agnès de Hohenstaufen,
_où jai imaginé un emploi de lorchestre remplacant parfaitement
lorgue._

Since then he had tried his hand at a new work, Les Atheniennes; the
Crown Prince (now King of Prussia[13]) had urged him to finish this
work, and to testify to the truth of his words, he took several letters
which he had received from this monarch out of his pocket-book, and
handed them to us for inspection. - number of characters: 594

There were two methods of inflicting this: (1) from above downwards
 (_von oben nach unten_), in which the condemned man was despatched
 instantly owing to his neck getting broken from the start; and (2)
 from below upwards (_von unten nach oben_), which is the method
 referred to above, and in which all the limbs of the victim were
 broken previous to his body being actually twisted through the spokes
 of the wheel.—Editor


These were the last impressions I carried away from the scene of my
first artistic efforts and of my attempts at earning an independent
livelihood. - number of characters: 588

Everything connected with a theatrical performance
had for me the charm of mystery, it both bewitched and fascinated me,
and while I was trying, with the help of a few playmates, to imitate
the performance of Der Freischutz, and to devote myself energetically
to reproducing the needful costumes and masks in my grotesque style of
painting, the more elegant contents of my sisters wardrobes, in the
beautifying of which I had often seen the family occupied, exercised a
subtle charm over my imagination; nay, my heart would beat madly at the
very touch of one of their dresses. - number of characters: 585

Now, as I never carried my piety to the extent of taking
directions absolutely literally, rather than sacrifice the effect
really intended by the master to the erroneous indications given, I
made the strings play only moderately loudly instead of real
fortissimo, up to the point where they alternate with the wind
instruments in taking up the continuation of the new theme: thus the
motive, rendered as it was as loudly as possible by a double set of
wind instruments, was, I believe for the first time since the existence
of the symphony, heard with real distinctness. - number of characters: 578

When at last, as a young man, I used to listen to the Zillmann
Orchestra in the Grosser Garten almost every afternoon, one may imagine
the rapturous thrill with which I drew in all the chaotic variety of
sound that I heard as the orchestra tuned up: the long drawn A of the
oboe, which seemed like a call from the dead to rouse the other
instruments, never failed to raise all my nerves to a feverish pitch of
tension, and when the swelling C in the overture to Freischutz told me
that I had stepped, as it were with both feet, right into the magic
realm of awe. - number of characters: 570
